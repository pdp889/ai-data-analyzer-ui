   npm install
   ```

3. Environment Configuration:
   Create a `.env` file with:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
   VITE_ENV=development
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Building for Production

1. Build the project:
   ```bash

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Feature-First Organization**:
   - Each feature is self-contained with its own components, hooks, services, and types
   - Promotes modularity and maintainability
   - Makes it easier to understand and modify feature-specific code

2. **Service Layer**:
   - API calls are abstracted into service files
   - Services handle error handling and response formatting
   - Hooks use services for data fetching and mutations
   - Request timeouts and error handling implemented
   - Automatic session token management

3. **Shared Resources**:
   - Common components, hooks, and utilities are placed in the shared directory
   - Constants are separated into their own files
   - Type definitions are co-located with their features
   - Centralized session management

4. **Type Safety**:
   - Comprehensive TypeScript types for all components and functions
   - Explicit return types for better type inference
   - Shared type definitions for common interfaces

5. **Security**:
   - CSP implementation for resource control
   - Input sanitization for user inputs
   - Secure file handling and validation
   - Environment variable protection
   - Secure headers configuration
   - Token-based session management

## Environment Variables

- `VITE_API_URL`: Base URL for the API
- `VITE_ENV`: Environment name (development/production)

## Development

- `npm run dev`: Start development server
- `npm run build`: Build for production
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint
- `npm run preview`: Preview production build

## Performance Optimizations

- Code splitting for better load times
- Optimized build configuration
- Efficient state management with React Query
- Proper error boundary implementation
- Request timeout handling
- Efficient file handling
- Automatic session token management
